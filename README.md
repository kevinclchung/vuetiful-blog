# A Vuetiful Blog

Hello, John and the rest of the Vuetify team!

Thank you for your considering me for this exciting contract with your team. I had
a lot of fun on this project, and I hope that you consider it as an example
of a submission that understands Vuetify throughly while meeting challenge
requirements.

Some notes:
- No DB is spun up. To preserve application state through refreshes, localStorage is used. As such the app must live with same constraints: application state lives per origin, and must not exceed storage limitations.
- To keep with standard UX conventions, you must log in to create a blog entry. But no auth has been incorporated in the project (yet); you need only select a profile, so that the profile is automatically selected as the author of any new blog entries.
- The project is responsive to mobile port widths, and will automatically change light and dark themes based on the client's (eg. system) preferred color scheme.
- Check out a fun egg: Click on the karate button at the bottom of the Edit Entry form.

Thanks again,<br>
Kevin
